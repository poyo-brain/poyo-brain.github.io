                Introduction
            </h3>
            <p>
                Our ability to use deep learning approaches to decipher neural activity would likely benefit from
                greater scale, in terms of both the model size and the datasets. However, the integration of many neural
                recordings into one unified model is challenging, as each recording contains the activity of different
                neurons from different individual animals.
            </p>

            <p>
                In this paper, we introduce a training framework and
                architecture designed to model the population dynamics of neural activity across diverse, large-scale
                neural recordings. Our method first tokenizes individual spikes within the dataset to build an efficient
                representation of neural events that captures the fine temporal structure of neural activity. We then
                employ cross-attention and a PerceiverIO backbone to further construct a latent tokenization of neural
                population activities. Utilizing this architecture and training framework, we construct a large- scale
                multi-session model trained on large datasets from seven nonhuman primates, spanning over 158 different
                sessions of recording from over 27,373 neural units and over 100 hours of recordings.
            </p>

            <p>
                In a number of
                different tasks, we demonstrate that our pretrained model can be rapidly adapted to new, unseen sessions
                with unspecified neuron correspondence, enabling few-shot performance with minimal labels. This work
                presents a powerful new approach for building deep learning tools to analyze neural data and stakes out
                a clear path to training at scale for neural decoding models.

                Neurons communicate asynchronously using electrical impulses called spikes. The timing and
                frequency of spikes encode signals that convey information about the external world and coordinate
                the internal dialogue within the brain.

            </h3>
            <p>
                Neural spikes, also known as action potentials, are brief electrical signals that travel along the axon
                of a neuron. They are the primary means by which information is transmitted within the nervous system.
                When a neuron receives sufficient input from other neurons, it generates a spike, which can then
                influence downstream neurons.

            </h3>
            <p>
                We can record the spiking activity of a population of neurons by placing electrodes near the neurons,
                and measuring the voltage changes that occur when a neuron fires. We commonly refer to these types of
                recordings as extracellular electrophysiology recordings.
            </p>

            <p> A device is implented in the brain, and will typically have multiple electrodes.
                An electrode doesn't just pick up the activity of a single neuron. Instead, it detects the electrical
                activity from
                multiple neurons that are in proximity to the electrode tip.
                <!-- each neuron has its own unique spiking
                pattern and amplitude based on its type, location, and distance from the electrode. When multiple
                neurons fire action potentials, the electrode picks up a combination of these spikes, which can often
                overlap in time. -->

                This situation is analogous to the "cocktail party problem" in auditory processing. The cocktail party
                problem refers to the challenge of focusing on a single conversation in a noisy environment, such as a
                party, where multiple people are talking at the same time. Similarly, in neural recordings, the
                challenge is to distinguish and isolate the spiking activity of an individual neuron from the "noise" of
                other nearby neurons.

                To address this, researchers use spike sorting techniques. Spike sorting involves analyzing the recorded
                signals to identify and group spikes that likely originated from the same neuron. This is done based on
                features such as spike shape, amplitude, and timing.

                This produces a spike train, which is a sequence of discrete events that represent the times at which
                each neuron fired.

            <p>
                Recording from the exact same neurons across multiple days using extracellular electrodes presents
                several challenges. can shift the relative position of neurons with respect to
                the electrode. This means that an electrode that was capturing the activity of a particular neuron one
                day might be slightly off-target the next day.
                <!-- <li> Physical Movement: The brain is a soft tissue, and even minor movements (e.g., due to breathing,
                minor head adjustments, or tissue swelling) can shift the relative position of neurons with respect to
                the electrode. This means that an electrode that was capturing the activity of a particular neuron one
                day might be slightly off-target the next day.</li>

                <li> Electrode Drift: Over time, the electrode itself can shift within the tissue. This can be due to
                various reasons, including the natural healing processes of the tissue around the implanted electrode,
                or mechanical factors related to the electrode's design.</li>

                <li> Tissue Response: The insertion and presence of an electrode can cause a tissue response. This
                might include inflammation, gliosis (formation of a scar-like tissue around the electrode), or neuronal
                death around the insertion site. Over time, these changes can alter the local neural environment,
                affecting which neurons are in proximity to the electrode.</li>

                <li> Neuronal Variability: Even if you were recording from the same neuron, its activity might
                naturally vary from day to day due to changes in the animal's state, experiences, or other factors. This
                variability can sometimes make it seem as though you're recording from different neurons, even if you
                aren't.</li>

                <li> Signal Quality: The quality of recordings can change over time. Factors like electrode
                degradation, changes in impedance, or accumulation of biological material on the electrode surface can
                alter the signal-to-noise ratio, potentially masking spikes from certain neurons.</li>

                Because of these challenges, while it's possible to record from the same general region of the brain
                across multiple days, it's difficult to guarantee that you're recording from the exact same neurons.
                Researchers often use statistical methods and other techniques to assess the stability of their
                recordings and to determine whether they are likely recording from the same or different neuronal
                populations across sessions.</li> -->

                Previous approaches: Binning
            </h3>

            <p>
                Because of the irregular nature of neural spiking activity, established approaches usually rely on
                temporally
                binned analyses: time is divided into discrete intervals, and the number of spikes for a unit within
                each interval is counted. Binned representations regularize the structure of spiking data and enable
                compatibility with existing machine learning frameworks.
            </p>

            <iframe src="./spike_binning.html" width="900" height="400" scrolling="no"
                style="overflow:hidden;"></iframe>

            <p>
                However, the choice of bin size presents a trade-off: longer windows (> 100ms) simplify the temporal
                dimension but sacrifice crucial spike-timing information, while shorter
                windows (1 ms) maintain individual spikes but result in an extremely sparse data format.
            </p>

            <h3 class="subsection-title">
                Our solution
            </h3>

            <p>
                By avoiding the need to aggregate or bin the neural activity, our approach can be more
                computationally efficient than previous methods while still maintaining high decoding accuracy. Overall,
                our choice of tokenizing spikes directly offers a promising new approach to neural decoding that
                combines high temporal resolution with computational efficiency.
            </p>

            <p>
                The neural tokenizer. Based upon these motivations, we propose a novel approach for tokenizing neural
                population activity where each spike is represented as a token. Each token contains information about
                the timing of a spike and the unique identity of its unit (the neuron it belongs to). As such, we
                represent our input as a set of tokens of arbitrary length. This is different from the established
                approach of temporal binning (counting the number of spikes in fixed temporal windows), which is
                typically used with neural data. Because we represent the input data as a set of arbitrary size we never
                define or fix the expected number of units, so the model can ingest arbitrary populations of units, and
                thus can be trained across many datasets. At the same time, by representing the time of each spike and
                avoiding representing the times where the neuron doesn’t spike, we avoid the vectors containing mostly
                zeros, as is common in binned representations of neural activity.
            </p>

            <p>
                To make this precise, we assign each unit a unique identifier and a corresponding D-dimensional
                learnable embedding. Let Embed(·) denote a lookup table that associates each unit to its unit embedding.
                Akin to word embeddings that encode semantic meaning and relationship between words, the unit embedding
                space encodes something about the “speaker’s” identity and role in neural computation. A unit fires a
                sequence of spikes in a window of time [0, T ]. Each spike i will be represented by a token
                characterized by (xi, ti), where xi = Embed(spike i′s unit) is the token’s embedding and ti is the spike
                timestamp. Collectively, and for an arbitrary set of units, we combine all the spikes into a sequence of
                length M . The population neural activity is represented by [x1 , . . . , xM ] and their corresponding
                times [t1, . . . , tM ]. While T represents the size of our context window, M will vary depending on the
                number of units in the population and their firing rates (see Figure 1). Note that all spikes from a
                specific unit have the same embedding xi, and only differ in their timing.

            <p>
                With our tokenization techniques, the problem of Neural Decoding
                boils down to learning a model that converts a sequence of spike
                tokens to a sequence of hand-velocities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our approach utilizes the Transformer architecture, recognized for
                its excellence in handling sequence-to-sequence transformations.
                Given the potentially large number of spikes in a single
                experimental trial, we've adopted DeepMind's PerceiverIO
                architecture <a href="https://www.deepmind.com/open-source/perceiver-io">
                    [Jeagle et al.]</a> instead of the standard transformer
                <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">[Vaswani et al.]</a>.
                To inject token timestamps into the attention
                blocks, we use Rotary Position Embeddings
                <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09864">[Su et. al.]</a>,
                which is a compute efficient way to ensure our model is
                invariant to absolute-time shifts.

            <p>There are two ways to transfer POYO-1 on new datasets:

            <p><b>1. Unit Identification</b>: In order to transfer to a new neural
            population with unseen neurons, we need a way to first assign them
            a Unit Embedding. We leverage gradient descent to learn the
            embeddings of new units, while keeping the rest of the network
            weights fixed. Notably, the function that maps the neural
            population activity to behavior is unchanged and is simply
            transferred to the new dataset. In our experiments, we find that
            this approach is surprisingly effective and allows us to rapidly
            integrate new datasets into the same underlying model. </p>
